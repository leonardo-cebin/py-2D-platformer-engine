# py-2D-platformer-engine

A simple but effective prototype to showcase my example of a 2D game engine made in Python. Coded in a single day, using 6 sprites in total, demonstrating the usability of WASD keys.

All 6 Mario's sprites are directly extracted from Super Mario Bros (1985) and all rights belong to Nintendo. The background is extracted from Super Mario World and belongs to Nintendo as well.
